    "# Queries on Exoplanet Data: Queries and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This document reports the details of a SQL project, the code of which is contained in the file \"exoplanets.sql\". The code is written using the language of MySQL 8 and is executed using the tool DbVisualizer. The data is taken from the site of NASA, using the latest data on exoplanet discoveries as of 15 October 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset is a report of an exoplanet discovery. From left to right, the columns represent the following: the row number, the name of the planet, the name of the star(s), the HD index of the star(s), the number of stars in that planetary system, the number of planets discovered in that planetary system, the method of discovery, the year of discovery, the facility that made the discovery, the paper in which the details of that planet are documented, and the paper in which the details of the star(s) are documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig1](screenshot_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Some stars do not appear in the Henry Draper Catalog and thus do not have a HD index. For these stars, the column hd_id has an empty string. A better indication of the HD index being nonexistent would be to use the value `NULL`. We thus replace all the empty strings in that column with `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig2](screenshot_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We can count the number of distinct planets and planetary systems in the table. The table contains a total of 36424 entries. Meanwhile, we find that there are only 5766 distinct planets in the table. This is because most planetary discoveries are reported in more than one paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig3](screenshot_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 3\n",
    "\n",
    "We can count how much the name of each planet appears in the table to know in how many papers it has appeared. Using this, we can identify the planet that has appeared in the most papers. Here we have the account for the possibility that there is a tie, in which case multiple planets have appeared in the most papers, so we cannot use `LIMIT 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig4](screenshot_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 4\n",
    "\n",
    "We can list the papers in which the planet from the previous query appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig5](screenshot_5.png)\n",
    "![fig6](screenshot_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 5\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the facilities that have discovered the most new exoplanets. Here we have to be careful to not count the same planet multiple times, since most planets appear several times in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig7](screenshot_7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of stars in a planetary system can vary. For each possible number of stars, we can find how many distinct planetary systems there are in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig8](screenshot_8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 7\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same as in the previous query but only for stars that have a HD index.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig9](screenshot_9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 8\n",
    "\n",
    "We can count how many distinct exoplanets were discovered in each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig10](screenshot_10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 9\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rank the discovery methods by how many exoplanets were discovered using it in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig11](screenshot_11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 10\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a window function to specify the first year in which that facility discovered an exoplanet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig12](screenshot_12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above query, it is now easy to find how many exoplanets each facility discovered in their first year.\n",
